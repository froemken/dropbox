If you update `dropbox` to a newer version, please read this section carefully!


Update to Version 5.0.0
=======================

Please execute the token wizard in driver record again to retrieve a fresh
refresh token. With that refresh token EXT:dropbox is available to generate
a new access token which is available for 4 hours. Remaining time of
current access token you can see in dropbox info section of dropbos driver
record.

Im future files get bigger and bigger. Downloading these files just to access
the image dimension (width/height) can be very slow, costs traffic and of
cause CPU time. With version 5.0.0 I use the dropbox API to retrieve this
information. This is faster if you have a lot of huge files in your selected
folder, but it's slower, if you have a lot of tiny small files in your folder.

Dropbox API can only retrieve image dimension (width/height) for images up to
20 MB.


Update to Version 4.3.0
=======================

The access tokens generated by/for Dropbox have now a lifetime of max. 4 hours.
So, we can not store the access token anymore. THX goes to TYPO3 community
which provides a pull request to migrate to refresh tokens which can be used
to generate new temporary available access tokens.

Please edit your dropbox storage and execute the refresh token wizard.

The new access tokens will be stored in sys_registry. On error while
working with the API EXT:dropbox will automatically try to refresh
the access token and tries the same request again.

Update to Version 4.2.0
=======================

A big thank you goes to Georg Ringer, who kindly gave me the extension
key "dropbox". I took the chance and renamed all paths, PHP classes, names and
repos to the new extension key "dropbox".

Please execute the ``Rename Extension Key Upgrade`` wizard from install tool to
rename the driver identifier in all sys_file_storage records of existing
Dropbox storages.


Update to Version 4.1.0
=======================

I have added TYPO3 11 compatibility. With this change my ext `dropbox` is
not compatible with PHP versions less than 7.4 anymore.
This version is still TYPO3 10.4 compatible, but needs at least PHP 7.4.
